## Problem Statement
I was asked if I could make a simple application to ask the user questions, score them, and produce results for them based on a provided database.

## Solution
Using experience and knowledge from another project where I am developing an application in python, I set out to develop a simple prototype. This prototype uses wxPython to render all the necessary details of the application.

All information provided to me was converted into yaml files and text files to work better with python. I've included some slightly unnecessary segmentation such as the config.py file so that I can have one set of information for the repo online to show my work, and a separate one for production, so that this repo does not contain any information as to the purpose of this test.
